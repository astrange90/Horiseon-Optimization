# Horiseon-Optimization
This project assignment was to refactor an existing code for a client's site to have accessibility.
The site also needed to be more optimized for search engines
I added alt texts to all images and icons
Cleaned up the structure of the original code with clear html semantics
Fixed a bug with the Search Engine Optimization link not working by adding missing ID property.
